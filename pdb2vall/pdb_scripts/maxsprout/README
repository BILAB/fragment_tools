  (1) MaxSprout is a fast database algorithm for generating protein backbone and
      side chain co-ordinates from a C(alpha) trace. The backbone is assembled from
      fragments taken from known structures. Side chain conformations are optimized
      in rotamer space using a rough potential energy function to avoid clashes.

                           ACADEMIC LICENCE AGREEMENT
                           FOR THE PROGRAM  MaxSprout
                                 BY Liisa Holm
 
An academic licence agreement for the MaxSprout program
(c) L. Holm 1987-2006
 
is granted to ....................................
 
in exchange for the following commitments:
 
I hereby certify that
 
        (1) I am an academic user at an academic research institution. In
            using the software, We will respect the interests of the authors
            and their institutions.
 
        (2) I will not use the software in commercial activities without
            a written commercial licence agreement; commercial activities
            include, in particular, work under contract from a commercial
            company.
 
        (3) I will not redistribute the software to others outside of my
            immediate research group. I will suggest to other interested
            research groups to contact the authors directly. When I leave
            my current institution, I will either delete the software or
            reapply for a new licence.
 
        (4) I will not alter or suppress the run-time copyright message.
 
        (5) I will acknowledge the program authors on any publication of
            scientific results based in part on use of the program and
            cite the article in which the program was described [Holm L 
            & Sander C (1991). Database algorithm for generating protein 
            backbone and side chain co-ordinates from a Ca trace.
            Application to model building and detection of co-ordinate
            errors. J Mol Biol 218:183-194].
 
        (6) I will report evidence of program bugs to the authors.
 
        (7) I will send the source code of any bug corrections and program
            extensions, major or minor, to the original authors, for free
            academic use. If I have made major extensions which are incor-
            porated by the authors, I reserve the right to be appropriately
            included in any future commercial licence agreement.
 
        (8) I will not extract part of the software, e.g. modules or sub-
            routines, for use in other contexts without permission by the
            authors.
 
        (9) I will not use the program in the context of classified research.
