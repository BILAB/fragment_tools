placeholder_seqs is a small file of arbitrary fasta sequences.

This is used by the script "structure_profile_scripts/create_checkpoint_from_fasta_alignment.pl"
to allow blast to quickly create a binary checkpoint file given an input alignment. The search 
results against placeholder_seqs is not used.

You must create a Blast formatted database using the following command:

  formatdb -o T -i placeholder_seqs
