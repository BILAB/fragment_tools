[?] Server paper (for modification of original algorithm)

Input: input PDB file.
Output: output PDB file, with beta-factor column replaced with depth of the atom

solvent type default to water, SPC216 model. User can submit their own solvation box. But the following parameters have to be reconfigured:
	[-w] [-box_x] [-box_y] [-box_z] [-sol_diameter] [-clash_dist] 

Number of iteration default to 25. Normally a smaller number (around 10) is sufficient.
Cavity size default to 4.2 Angstrom (1.5 hydration shell). 
Vdw-distance from protein atom to solvent atom default to 2.6 Angstrom.
Minimum number of neighbouring bulk solvents to define a bulk solvent default to 2.
To visually inspect multiple solvent configuration, use -keep flag. Argument to the flag will be the filename to save for each configuration.

example: 
% ./DEPTH -i 1MVT.pdb -o 1MVT -n 10 -survive 3 -keep 1MVT-sol
# compute residue depth for 1MVT.pdb, 10 iterations, cavity-size = 3 solvents, keep minimally solvated structures
output files:
1MVT-atom.depth: atomistic depth
1MVT-residue.depth: residue depth
1MVT-atomic_depth.pdb: PDB file with beta value column replaced with atomistic depth
1MVT-residue_depth.pdb: PDB file with beta value column replaced with residue depth
1MVT-sol-?.pdb: minimally solvated structure files

complex-depth
Usage: Calculate change of residue depth value upon proteins forming complexes
OPTION
	-i input.pdb 
	-o output 
	[-n] iteration-number (Default 25) 
	[-survive] minimum-number-of-neighbouring-solvent (Default 2) 
	[-keep] minimally-solvated-models-filename (Default NULL) 
	[-cavity] cavity-size (Default 4.2)  
	[-w] solvent_box.pdb (Default ($PWD)/water_models/spc216.pdb)
	[-box_x] length of solvation box in x-dimenson (Default 19)
	[-box_y] length of solvation box in y-dimension (Default 19)
	[-box_z] length of solvation box in z-dimension (Default 19)
	[-sol_diameter] solvent-diameter (Default 2.8) 
	[-clash_dist] vdw-distance(solvent, solute) (Default 2.6)
	[-thread] number-of-threads

Explanation:
All parameters and algorithms are the same with DEPTH, except that the program takes in a PDB files with multiple chains. It generates residue depth for individual chains (before) and complexes (after), their difference and standard deviation
input: PDB file (with multiple chains)

example:
% ./complex-depth -i 1LXY.pdb -o 1LXY.depth_dif
output:
atomistic, residue depth and corresponding PDB files (see explanation of DEPTH)
1LXY.depth_dif: change of residue depth upon chains forming complexes


ASA
Usage: Calculate residue solvent accessibility
syntax: ./ASA input.pdb resolution probe-size output
Option:
	resolution: number of points placed on sphere (recommended value = 92)
	probe-size: radius of solvent (in Angstrom). For water, use 1.4

Explanation
For algorithm, see 'Shrake A, Rupley JA. (1973). Environment and exposure to solvent of protein atoms. Lysozyme and insulin. J Mol Biol 79(2):351-71'

example:
./ASA 1MVT.pdb 92 1.4 1MVT.asa


predict-binding-site
Usage: Predict binding cavity of small ligand(s) for input structure
Option:
	-d depth-profile 
	-a asa-profile 
	-p parameter-file 
	-o output 
	-c input.pdb 
	[-y] output.pdb
	[-e] output.depth-asa

Explanation:
Discrepancy between residue depth and corresponding accessible surface area suggests a cavity on protein surface, potentially a binding site of small ligand. Bayesian probability of involvent of a binding site of each amino-acid type within such cavity is computed.

example:
./predict-binding-site -d 1MVT-residue.depth -a 1MVT.asa -p par/:3 -o 1MVT.cavity3.prediction -c 1MVT.pdb -y 1MVT.cavity3.pdb
* take note of how parameter-file is specified. For cavity of size 4 solvents, use -p par/:4, etc.

output files:
1MVT.cavity3.prediction:list of residue and its probability value of involvement in binding cavity
1MVT.cavity3.pdb:		PDB file with beta factor column replaced by probability value
